  "summary": "Currently transitioning into the Information Technology field, I bring over 12 years of experience in retail management, having worked as a warehouse supervisor, section manager, and currently as a store manager. With strong skills in team leadership, problem-solving, and operational management, I am now focused on applying these strengths to my growing expertise in software development. I am a student at 42 School, where I am in Rank 5/6, gaining in-depth knowledge in C programming, Linux, and computer science fundamentals. Additionally, I completed a 50-hour ASP.NET Core MVC course (UFCD 10792), using C#, MySQL, and Entity Framework to build a full CRUD application. I am seeking an opportunity to apply and further develop my technical skills in a professional environment.",
